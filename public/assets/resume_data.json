      "description": "From a young age, I’ve always been a hands-on learner. Troubleshooting Windows issues for the neighbors (I made plenty of mistakes along the way) was where it all began. My passion for problem-solving led me to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, where I built a strong foundation in programming with C++ and Java and discovered my love for web development. Today, I specialize in frontend development, using React.js and Tailwind CSS to create seamless, responsive user interfaces. My background in networking and cybersecurity has been invaluable in my experience with Azure Cloud, where I design and deploy scalable, secure solutions. I’m passionate about building systems that are both functional and user-friendly. When I’m not coding, I’m exploring new technologies or reading a good book."
